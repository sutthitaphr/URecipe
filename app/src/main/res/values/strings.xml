        <b>URecipe</b> is a mobile application that has various recipes from around the world. Not only such recipes are in the application but also includes the weirdest and wildest but tastiest menu that people may never hear of. This references the application name \“URecipe\”,  which stands for \“Unique Recipe\”.
        \n\nThe URecipe application is designed to act as a kitchen assistant, making cooking easier, faster, and more convenient. A virtual cook who may guide users and allow them to share their created unique dishes and chat with other users.

For the first two months of the Covid-19 lockdown, there were a ton of food photographs uploaded by people who loved to spend the lockdown perfecting their culinary abilities and this is the reason this project was chosen to undertake.
